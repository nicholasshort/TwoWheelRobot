# TwoWheelRobot

This is a project I started to learn more about control theory. 

The project consists of three main folders:
1) Arduino Code
2) Matlab/Python Pendulum on a Cart Simulation Files
3) Hand Derivations for the Linearized State Space model of a Pendulum on a Cart

I used matlab and python to simulate/verify my the state space model from my hand derivations, and to develop a full-state feedback control loop to control the cart and  pendulum about a fixed angle and position respectively. The results for this can be seen under "ControlAnSimulation" in the "PendulumCartSim" python file.
